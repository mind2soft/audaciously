# Notes

## Sequences

Operations:

- **paste** :
  - splice : move all audio data and insert audio buffer in place
  - splace all : same as splice, but affect place of all audio tracks
  - fill : fill any silence with audio buffer
  - overwrite : write audio buffer in place and overwrite/truncate any other buffer
